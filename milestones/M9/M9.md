# Milestone 9

Summary of Activity from 23/12/2021 to 24/01/2022

The milestone was dedicated to "tie up loose ends". The main
loose ends was to update to [Http Message Signatures v07](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-07.html#section-5.1)
so that the code can run on Java or JS clients or servers. 
One hope here is that this may be of interest to 
  * companies interested in the IETF Standard (people working with AWS perhaps, since the standard
is edited by [Annabelle Backman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/annabelle-backman-2687323/) of Amazon where it started as [SIGV4](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/sigv4_signing.html))
  * Solid Java or JavaScript servers wishing to add Http Signature authentication, since the code compiles to Java and JS.
  * Solid Clients such as [Dokieli](https://github.com/linkeddata/dokieli/issues/311) 

The hope is to have something minimal that can be used very widely.

## Signing Http Messages

Continuing on work from [the previous Milestone](../M7/M7.md) on "Signing HTTP Messages":

1. Enhancements to [bobcats PR 48](https://github.com/typelevel/bobcats/pull/48).
The changes can be seen more clearly in [the branch history](https://github.com/bblfish/bobcats/commits/bbl/main).
2. Consolidate [httpSig](https://github.com/bblfish/httpSig/)
   1. After research, decided to use `IO` monad for both Akka and http4s to deal with effects
   2. using  [Scala Match Types](https://docs.scala-lang.org/scala3/reference/new-types/match-types.html), 
   following the example of [banana-rdf Scala3](https://github.com/banana-rdf/banana-rdf/blob/0f06c95dad8e6d9cc0f5520d20532a1e8935d305/rdf/shared/src/main/scala/org/w3/banana/RDF.scala#L57), 
   we're able to abstract the HTTP Model of Akka and Http4s frameworks (java and JS), 
   for maximum reduction of code duplication between HTTP4s and Akka versions. 
   As a result we now have *one* set of test suites that cover both frameworks. As an
   example the > 700 line [HttpMessageSigningSuite](https://github.com/bblfish/httpSig/blob/e967f7ded1bfc6ea1da2ae7a2717d0bfc4e7866a/ietfSig/shared/src/test/scala/run/cosy/http/auth/HttpMessageSigningSuite.scala#L76)
   tests is implemented [in Akka here](https://github.com/bblfish/httpSig/blob/main/akka/src/test/scala/run/cosy/http/auth/AkkaHttpMessageSigningSuite.scala).
      (Neither http4s nor Akka provide a simple function to parse a string into an HTTP Message sadly, or most of
   that Akka subclass code could have been compressed to one line)
   

Remaining work to be done:
  1. Finish HttpSig
     * finish implementing generic tests for http signature and specific test for http4s
     * publish artifacts for bobcats and httpsig (at this point SNAPSHOT artifacts)
  2. Use HttpSig library
     1. replace previous implementation in the [Reactive Solid Server](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD)
     2. in the [SolidCtrlApp](https://github.com/bblfish/SolidCtrlApp) so that a 
  3. polish the bobcats PR - the current version works but the API needs improvement
