## 1. Client Auth Pre-requisites

The Client Auth library must function in the browser using JavaScript. 
In order for client and server coding to be as closely aligned as possible
this means either writing Client ScalaJS facades for existing JS libraries,
or rewriting them in pure Scala. We start by building facades, leaving it for later to
rewrite pure Scala libraries if needed.

1. Scala-JS parser for Turtle and other similar RDF Formats
2. to port the "Signing HTTP Messages" library from Akka to Http4s
3. contribution to bobcats crypto library for Scala and Scala-js.

### a. Scala-JS Turtle Parser

Years ago I wrote a a pure Scala [NTriples parser](https://github.com/banana-rdf/banana-rdf/tree/scala-3/ntriples/shared/src/main/scala/org/w3/banana/io) 
that can compile to ScalaJS for banana-rdf. But for a client to work
on the web we need Turtle, NTrig, etc... I found Ruben Verborgh's 
[N3.js](https://github.com/rdfjs/N3.js) library, which provides asynchronous
parsers for Turtle, TriG, N-Triples, N-Quads, RDF* and Notation3 (N3).
(On second thoughts I realised I should perhaps have written a facade f
or [graphy.js](https://github.com/blake-regalia/graphy.js)). 

In order to build something that could work efficiently on the client but use
abstractions that could also work nicely on a JS or Java server, I decided 
to use the [typelevel](https://typelevel.org) effect stack consisting of 
  * [Cats Effect](https://typelevel.org/cats-effect/) - core effect library
  * [FS2](https://fs2.io/#/) - streaming library, building on cats effect
  * [http4s](https://http4s.org) - http library that builds on both the above
  
The result is now part of the [SolidCtrlApp](https://github.com/bblfish/SolidCtrlApp)
so that the code is close to the Application which uses it. 
Later when stable it can be moved to a [banana-rdf](https://github.com/banana-rdf/banana-rdf) io module. 

The interface is simple and composable. A parser transforms a stream of N3 bytes to a stream
of quads, fitting nicely into a async flow.

```scala
val quads: Stream[Pure, Quad] = N3Parser.parse(streamOfTriples)
```

### b. Signing Http Messages library

In [Milestone 3](../M3/M3.md) I worked on implementing the IETF's 
[Signing HTTP Messages](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures/)
(v7 was just released) which is part of the [Reactive Solid Codebase](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD/tree/master/src/main/scala/run/cosy/http/headers).
As I needed this for the client I extracted the code into its 
own repository [httpSig](https://github.com/bblfish/httpSig) so that other
Scala, Java or JS projects can more easily make use of the code. 
The project will contain 3 or 4 projects:
 * A pure Scala implementation of rfc8941 on which "Signing HTTP Messages" depends
 * The Akka implementation of "Signing Http Messages"
 * An Http4s implementation, compiling to JS and Java byte-code 
 * Hopefully a library that collects the commonalities between the Akka and Http4s versions if possible

The reason we have an Akka and Http4s versions is that those two frameworks use
similar but different header libraries. 

If any of these are of interest to other projects please put them in 
contact with me.

### c. Bobcats

In order to build the HttpSig signing and verification layer
I needed a crypto library that would present a unified interface for Scala
and Scala-JS. I found the author of the new [Typlevel Bobcats](https://github.com/typelevel/bobcats/) 
library who suggested I make a PR to add Signing and Verification part. 
I have submitted [PR 39](https://github.com/typelevel/bobcats/pull/39)
that has implemented the core Java features and will next write the 
Scala-JS implementation. The tests work against the IETF Signing Http 
messages spec.

## Putting it all-together

The rest of the month I want to finish the above projects so that I can
get to building a very basic Wallet (see [AuthN.scala](https://github.com/bblfish/SolidCtrlApp/blob/main/authn/src/main/scala/run/cosy/app/auth/AuthN.scala)
that can authenticate using [HTTPSig](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/blob/main/proposals/HttpSignature.md)
built on "Signing HTTP Messages".

## Other

The last milestone called "Closing" is there to tie up loose ends like those above.
