# Milestone 10

Summary of Activity from 25 Jan 2022 - 28 Feb 2022

This smaller milestone was dedicated to making relase-ready all the projects worked on. This involved
  * setting up each project for Continuous Integration following [Typelevel](https://typelevel.org/about.html) standards, so that new commits can only pass if
    * formatting guidelines are followed
	 * copyright statements are available in every code file
	 * test suites pass
	 * all code is fixed so that no warning messages are generated by the compiler
  * release SNAPSHOT artifacts that can be used by other projects (as these are tested and used successfully they will later be released to Maven Central). The artifacs were released here:
    * [oss.sonatype.org/net/bblfish/rdf](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/net/bblfish/rdf/)
	 * [oss.sonatype.org/net/bblfish/crypto](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/net/bblfish/crypto/)

The links to each of the projects and artifacts is available on the [README.md](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/solid-control)	 

It is not clear yet what type of release one should have for the [Reactive Solid Web Server](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD), which is not a library but an application. It could be published as the other artifacts have been. Another idea would be to have a working Dockerfile (see Michiel B Dejong's [PR 19](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD/pull/19))... 
Nevertheless, Continuous Integration is now setup for Reactive-SoLiD, the tests pass and it uses the released HttpSig libraries.

Work remaining to be done from the [previous milestone](../M9/M9.md) on [httpSig library](https://github.com/bblfish/httpSig/) library was completed. 

Also we still need to release the [SolidControlApp](https://github.com/bblfish/solidCtrlApp), but that requires some more work on the library itself, something to be done in a future milestones.
