# Solid-Control

Solid-Control is a project funded by the European Union Next Generation Internet (NGI) Privacy and Trust Enhancing Technologies (PET) fund. From the [official page](https://nlnet.nl/project/SolidControl/):

> Solid-Control aims to enhance Tim Berners-Lee's Social Linked Data Project (Solid) with Attribute-Based Access Control. 

> By extending the Linked Data Platform (LDP) with WebID based authentication and Access Control Lists (ACL), Solid has enabled the emergence of new forms of Hyper-Apps. These apps can follow data from server to server, authenticate when needed and write to the user's Personal Online Data storage (Pod), creating a decentralized social web.

> With relation-based access control (friend of a friend, business network, etc.), Solid can be a full alternative to centralized social networks. We also want to allow authentication based on Verifiable Claims such as age. Solid-Control will work on developing the needed logic, verify protocols, write prototype implementations and contribute to the Solid Auth Community groups, which are developing specs for standardization.

The project interacts with several different repositories on GitHub and mailing lists. This repository collects the reports on the activity in the various forums.

The main repositories regarding standard-settings are:

* [Solid Authentication Panel](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel) 
* [Solid Authorization Panel](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel)
* [Solid Interoperatbility Panel](https://github.com/solid/data-interoperability-panel)
* [Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/specification/)


The Code repositories are: 

* [Reactive-Solid](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD)
* [Banana-RDF](https://github.com/banana-rdf)

Additional Code repositories that were created along the way as their final location is still 
to be decided:
 
* [bblfish/httpSig](https://github.com/bblfish/httpSig) repository for Scala(JS) implementation of IETF "Signing HTTP Messages"
* [bblfish/rdf.scala.js](https://github.com/bblfish/rdf.scala.js) Scala JS facade for RDF.js interfaces
* [bblfish/SolidCtrlApp](https://github.com/bblfish/SolidCtrlApp) client in browser code for Solid Authentication

Other repositories being contributed to:
* [typelevel/bobcats](https://github.com/bblfish/bobcats) Cryptographic library in Functional Scala(JS)
