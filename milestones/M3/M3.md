## 0. Preparation

In order to be able to properly implement the work for this Milestone, I needed to update banana-rdf and re-implement HTTP-Signature.

### i) Banana-RDF

[Scala 3](https://dotty.epfl.ch) is a major upgrade to Scala and was [released in May](https://www.scala-lang.org/blog/2021/05/14/scala3-is-here.html). 

As [banana-rdf](https://github.com/banana-rdf/banana-rdf) is a core component of Reactive-Solid, it was felt to be worth-while bringing it as close as possible to Scala 3 compatibility, in order to get a clear idea of what will be needed to make the transition. This upgrade was done with [PR 364](https://github.com/banana-rdf/banana-rdf/pull/364) to banana-rdf. 

I also opened a discussion [to see what the best way to complete the transition](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/discussions/12527) could be. This is preliminary work for a later milestone dedicated to banana-rdf.

### ii) Http Signatures

The implementation of [HTTP Sig](https://github.com/solid/authentication-panel/blob/main/proposals/HttpSignature.md) from [Milestone 2](../M2/M2.md) depended on Tomitribe's [http-signatures-java](https://github.com/tomitribe/http-signatures-java/issues/51) which implemented an old version of the specification. 
There has not been any movement there, so I decided it would be better to implement it completely in Scala.

The [Signing HTTP Messages v04 RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures-04) depends on RFC8941: Structured Field Values for HTTP. So I first [implemented RFC8941](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD/issues/13) and then [rewrote Signing HTTP Messages Draft](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD/issues/14).

This led to the opening of some issues on the HTTP WG's github repo:
* [Signatures: Difficulty verifying B.2 examples](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/1475)
* [Signatures 04: Use lists instead of Inner lists for ยง2.3 Prefixes](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/1492)
* [Signatures 04: Typo in multiple Signatures signature string? ](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/1493)

These have now been fixed and version 05 of the spec is now out.


## 1. LDP Test Suite for Basic Containers

Todo: save output of the LDP test suite in the directory here and link to it. 
* [Issue 16: LDP Test Suite](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD/issues/16)
* I started looking at testing with the Solid Test suites too.

## 2. Implement Basic Access Control

This is covered in [Issue 17: Implement Basic WAC like Access Control](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD/issues/17).

Building the AuthZ layer one immediately comes to to think about inheritance of Access Control Rules. This happens as follows just by thinking about building a test suite:
1. The test suite has to start with an empty Pod, with perhaps at most one access control rule for the root container.
2. Then one will want to create containers and resources in that container: these will need to inherit the access control rules of the parent if they are to be editable or viewable at all. 

WAC has support for a basic form of default inheritance, but default reasoning is awakward on the semantic web, and so proposed using an `:imports` relation  as per [solid authz issue 210: add :imports relation](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/210). I had something similar in [rww-play 6 years ago](https://github.com/read-write-web/rww-play/wiki/Curl-Interactions) - though I called it `:includes` at the time. I find that makes it much easier to think about access control, so I implemented this in [Commit 7771d5871dd9c10f535200730f4290454c0d3032](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD/commit/7771d5871dd9c10f535200730f4290454c0d3032).

In order to implement Access Control flexibly I added a basic system of [Free Monad Scripts](https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/freemonad.html) defined in [SolidCmd.scala](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD/blob/master/src/main/scala/run/cosy/ldp/SolidCmd.scala). This allows one to for example write a script that [fetches a graph and the transitive closure of its :imports](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD/blob/master/src/main/scala/run/cosy/ldp/SolidCmd.scala#L194) related graphs. 

One advantage is that it makes it possible to test the script with a mock `WWW` and simple interpretation as in [TestLDPCmd.scala](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD/blob/master/src/test/scala/run/cosy/ldp/TestLDPCmd.scala#L77).  One can then interpret exactly the same script using Actors. Each command comes with a URL allowing it to gets Routed  to its own Actor and interpreted by that actor: a filesystem actor will read data from the FileSystem and Web Proxy actor read from the relevant remote resource, or from its cache, a DB Actor ... (see [the BasicContainer](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD/blob/master/src/main/scala/run/cosy/ldp/fs/BasicContainer.scala#L399) for example). This was done in RWW-Play too, but here we integrate this clearly with a pure streaming web server view via the `Wait` command to allow us to work with Futures when transforming an RDF Stream into a Graph for example.

The result of running the Free Monad, is a [Cofree Comonad](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD/blob/master/src/main/scala/run/cosy/ldp/SolidCmd.scala#L136), which interestingly enough is the structure of a RDF Dataset!


### Initial Caching mechanism

This is needed in order to fetch data such as group memberships from the web faster. Still todo.

### Work with Solid Auth Groups

#### Authorization Panel

* [2021-04-28](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/blob/main/meetings/2021-04-28.md) meeting notes, turned into a very nice, helpful and readable dialog.
* [Solid authz issue 210: add :imports relation](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/210)
* And other [panel meetings](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/blob/main/meetings/). 
  

#### Authentication Panel

There were fewer meetings here.
