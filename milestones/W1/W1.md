## Crypto Library Enhancements

In late September Mark Nottingham announced [on the HTTP Bis WG mailing list](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/ietf-http-wg/2022JulSep/0183.html) that the [httpbis-message-signatures](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpbis-message-signatures/) spec was in last call. That gave a very good reason to update first the [bobcats](https://github.com/typelevel/bobcats) crypto library and then the [HttpSig library](https://github.com/bblfish/httpSig). 

### Bobcats update

Bobcats is a library that provides the same Scala interface for Java cryptograph, as well as for Browser Cryptography. It could be extended for NodeJS if someone needed it.

* [PR7: Update with examples from Message Signatures 13](https://github.com/bblfish/bobcats/pull/7). Tested the signatures on all the examples in the Message Signing spec. Doing this led to me to find a difficulty with one of the PEM keys from the spec. [Issue 2290](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/issues/2290). That led to JWK versions of all the keys to be added to the spec in [PR 2301](https://github.com/httpwg/http-extensions/pull/2301) which led to
* [PR9: Add Support for JWK in bobcats](https://github.com/bblfish/bobcats/pull/9) 
* [PR 10: Update Dependencies](https://github.com/bblfish/bobcats/pull/10) - minor update for bobcats to work better with other libraries

I have a [huge PR](https://github.com/typelevel/bobcats/pull/129) to commit all the bobcats changes
to the original repo. I need to remove the conflicts, and then there is probably some work to be done to timprove the APIs for it, before it would get accepted. Having it used is most likely to have it accepted longer term.

Published new snapshot on sonatype [for Java](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/net/bblfish/crypto/bobcats_3/) and [JS](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/net/bblfish/crypto/bobcats_sjs1_3/)

### HttpSig update

* [PR 12: Updgrade to spec version 13](https://github.com/bblfish/httpSig/pull/12) took a whole month of work somehow as I cleaned up the interfaces, improved the tests, and made for a typesafe version of the library.
* [PR 11](https://github.com/bblfish/httpSig/pull/11) and [PR 19](https://github.com/bblfish/httpSig/pull/19) are minor fixes.

Published new snapshot on sonatype
 * http4s-http-signature [java](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/net/bblfish/crypto/http4s-http-signature_3/) and [browser JavaScript](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/net/bblfish/crypto/http4s-http-signature_sjs1_3/)
 * Other crypto libraries on which it depends are also in [net/bblfish/crypto](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/net/bblfish/crypto/) 

### Update to Reactive-Solid

* [PR 24: update bobcats and httpSig](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD/pull/24) updated Reactive Solid. This will continue as we develop more advanced examples from the SolidCtrl App.


### Update to client library

* [PR2: Update HttpSig](https://github.com/bblfish/SolidCtrlApp/pull/2), also contains some initial thoughts on how develop the client in a very generic way (see [Free Readme](https://github.com/bblfish/SolidCtrlApp/blob/CommandLine/free/shared/net/bblfish/ldp/cmd/README.md)) very similar to what I used on the server, so that it can easily fetch data in a cache, remotely, etc... This may be a way to develop a basic actor system on the client, that could then be used to rework the server later. 

### Other

Found a bug in Scala [Issue 16408: Problem with Traits not being Matchable](https://github.com/lampepfl/dotty/issues/16408). After finding the bug, minimizing the code was a lot of work, that was done intermittenlty over a 3 weeks or so. It looks like they have accepted it now.
