## ACP Basic Specification

### ACP, WAC, WAC+ evalutations

The situation on the ground is the following:

1. **WAC**: Carven Capadisli has reworked the [WAC spec 0.5.0 in wiki format](https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec/blob/main/README-v0.5.0.md) to a cleanly html formated [Web Access Control Spec](https://solid.github.io/web-access-control-spec/).

2. **ACP**: The PR for an [ACP specification](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/pull/183) is progressing and will be reviewed next week.

3. **WAC+**: are proposals for simple WAC extensions. I am defending the position that WAC can be extended in a backward compatible way to allow us to satisfy our use cases.  

We have worked on building up evaluations of ACP, WAC and WAC+ in the [evaluations](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/tree/main/proposals/evaluation) folder. The exercise of working through use cases very carefully by showing exactly what the communication between the client and the server have to be for the system to work has been I believe tremdendously helpful.  That work has been done carefully for these three two use-cases:

* [Effective Access Control Resource Discovery](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/blob/main/proposals/evaluation/uc-0-effective-acr.md), reveals a big efficiency problem with WAC. Four WAC+ solutions have been proposed, of which the most elegant is to [define a new Link relation](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/248).
* [Access Inheritance Use Cases](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/blob/main/proposals/evaluation/uc-3-inheritance.md), reveal a problem both with WAC and ACP in that both have to copy access control rules.
  * ACP has to copy each rule to the resources specific ACR, creating potential duplication problems during edits
  * WAC can have a resource containing default rules for a container hierarchy, but if that is overriden locally all rules have to be copied
  * [WAC+:imports](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/210) proposes to use an imports relation to solve the problem of duplication of rules

As a comparison there is no detailed flow worked out (yet) for the [Resource Access Use Case](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/blob/9b718f3c3f0943d1f4feb8d89079009435f82839/proposals/evaluation/uc-1-resource-access.md). It is assumed that data is just available, but the question as to how the client can **find** the data is not made clear.

The WAC+ exercise has not just brought up extensions to WAC, but also simplifications such as the
proposal to [deprecate acl:Control](https://github.com/solid/web-access-control-spec/issues/94).
That simplification could unblock quite a number of other problems, allowing publically accessible
rules for the many organisations that require transparency.

#### Authorization Panel meetings

The meetings were taken over by a discussion on UMA type protocols for the first month

Leading to two stories on [Consent Workflow Use Cases](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/blob/main/proposals/evaluation/uc-%3F-consent.md) that need to be worked out in detail.

## Implement Initial ACP based Access Control

The current implementation of Solid-Control has support for [:imports](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/210) and [Trig Serialisation of Access Control Rules](https://github.com/solid/authorization-panel/issues/247). 

Support of access to groups is just being worked on, and these should start involving group access based on 
descriptions such as friend of a friend social network relations. That should be in by the end of the month.

## Test Suites

Most of the commits since the last milestone have been Test Suite based.
See [Reactive Solid Commit log](https://github.com/co-operating-systems/Reactive-SoLiD/commits/master).
The next ones will add new functionality.

## Other

1. The [W3C WebID repository] has woken up a bit with [three issues added](https://github.com/w3c/WebID/issues).
2. I have been following the work on the Category of Polynomials. David Spivak has been giving a course on that at Berkley. Poly covers many of the concepts we are using in building Reative-Solid. See [twitter thread](https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1426553284966461452).
   * They [cover coalgebras](https://twitter.com/bblfish/status/1424454040985944066) which were used to model OO programming, systems and modal logic. 
   * They cover Lenses which in functional programming are used to focus in on a part of the data structure and make changes. There was a proposal in July for using those [to build web servers]([Lenses](https://mattecapu.github.io/ct-zulip-archive/stream/229156-practice:-applied-ct/topic/optics.20and.20servers.html). That did not feel dynamic enough to me at the time, but that was before I had looked at the work on Poly. 
   * There seems to be a strong relation between [Actors and Poly](https://mattecapu.github.io/ct-zulip-archive/stream/229450-practice:-programming/topic/Poly.20and.20Actors.3F.html) as it is a mathematics of dynamical systems that can change. 
   * Eric Neuman's [lise of ways Comonads](https://mattecapu.github.io/ct-zulip-archive/stream/229156-practice:-applied-ct/topic/web.20cats.html#247517065) tie to the Web.
